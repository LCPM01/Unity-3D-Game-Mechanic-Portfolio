# Unity-3D-Game-Mechanic-Portfolio
All scripts have been coded my myself and publicly shared online as a form of portfolio.
I am using GitHub to house my portfolio for personal and student projects.

Feel free to use aspects of my script or base scripts off of my work; however it would be appreciated if you linked the
GitHub page somewhere.

###### IMPORTANT ######
- Please do not try to sell these scripts as I do not intend for this.
- Please do not claim ownership if copying my scripts exactly.
